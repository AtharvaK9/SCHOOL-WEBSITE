            <p class="text-capitalize">Air Force Bal Bharati School (AFBBS) was started by the Indian Air Force Educational and Cultural Society with the aim of meeting the educational aspirations of children of Air Force Personnel posted to the National Capital Region. AFBBS made a humble beginning, as a Primary school, on 15th July 1955 with an initial strength of 116 students and 6 members of the staff. The school was then housed in war time barracks. Gradually, the painstaking efforts of the staff and the Management of AFBBS resulted in the School developing into one of the premier schools of Delhi.
By 1974 it had grown into a full-fledged Senior Secondary School offering educational facilities to over 3300 students from diverse backgrounds. Today, AFBBS functions under the aegis of Indian Air Force Educational and Cultural Society as a recognized, unaided private school. The school is affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi and offers educational facilities under 10+2 scheme of education. It also complies with the rules and regulations as prescribed in Delhi School Education Act and Rules-1973.
